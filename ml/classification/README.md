# ✨📚 Classification Playground 📚✨

Welcome to my **Classification practice zone**!  
This folder contains all my experiments and practice codes for learning **Machine Learning classification algorithms** using Python 🐍.  
I’m following along with 📘 *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow* and adding my own touch 🌸

## 🌟 What's Inside?

Each file is a little adventure in classification ✨  

- `firstclassification.py` 🐼  
  👉 My very first classifier using **SGD** & **Random Forest** to detect whether a digit is a "5" or not (from the MNIST dataset 💖).  
  - Uses **StratifiedKFold** for cross-validation  
  - Plots a **cute ROC curve** 🎨  
  - Prints **AUC scores** for model comparison
  - Just a binary classifier 

- More files will be added as I continue learning 🚀

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python 🐍  
- scikit-learn 🤖  
- matplotlib 📊
- and more as i learn more!

---

## 🌸 Goals
- Understand the intuition behind different classifiers 🧠  
- Write clean, well-commented code 📝  
- Compare models using metrics like Accuracy, ROC & AUC 🔍  
- Have fun while learning 💕

## 💡 Notes to Self
- 🌱 **SGDClassifier** → linear model, super fast but less flexible.  
- 🌳 **RandomForestClassifier** → non-linear, more powerful, usually gives higher ROC/AUC.  
- Remember: always split into train/test properly to avoid data leakage! 🚫💧
