# 🌸🐍 pythonpractice 🐍🌸

Welcome to **pythonpractice**!  
This is my little corner of the coding world where I brush up on my old Python concepts and write new codes to study new concepts!💻
I know this repo is named PYTHON practice, but I will include some basic ML codes to implement ML algorithms as well!✨  
I love turning concepts into **mini-projects**, because practice + fun = growth🌱, and so me happy!
